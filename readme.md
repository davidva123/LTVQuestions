The Lifetime Value CO Project

I used a combination of css-flexbox,bootstrap4,jquery,vanilla JS and plain css to achieve the changes requested.

- CSS
- File Layout Change
- JS
- Please Wait Spinner

# CSS

I updated the changes and would have made a gulp task to handle the autoprefixer and scss, but I chose to do it this way for ease of dissemination of data into your css structure.

# File Layout Change

I initially wanted to use SSI(**Server Side Includes**) which I used in my previous employment (**Windows IIS Hosting**) but had to leverage jquery load to add the header and footer and keep them in 1 place as to not repeat.

# JS

I added most of my changes in app.js to handle the button background color change as well as the decision logic.

# Please Wait Spinner

I wasn't able to mimic the please wait asset directly, but I was able to generate close facsimile on the results page.
